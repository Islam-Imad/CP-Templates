<code>Reading</code> ➡️ <code>Thinking</code> ➡️ <code>Coding</code> ➡️ <code>Debugging</code> ➡️ <code>Accepted</code>

# Reading 📖
- Read carefully, don't rush, and make sure that you have finished the rem of Reading section.
- Record constraints(Hint-Don't overestimate-Don't make any assumption).
- Missed, tricky, and boundary test cases. 
- Errors section.
- IO format.
- Tricky places.
- Trace samples.
- Are you sure?

# Thinking 🤔
- Backward or Forward.
- Incremental Thinking.
- On Paper not on pc.
- Concrete, Pictorial, or Symbolic.
- Subproblem.
- Solution! Verify(corner cases,sample test cases&more)🙂
- Don't rush for code(very important).
- Problem simplification.
- optimal
- ANALYZE each idea you have thoroughly.
- Tips: Planning is key with any algorithm. Make sure you have all the steps neatly laid out. 

# Coding 💻
- First check briefly that you are not missing easier idea/method to implement. That will save most time.
- Also adding one sentence comment to code on main idea of every problem might be nice if you ever need to refer back.
- code on paper first then on pc.
- after coding, check the code again.
- Struggle to write the code from the first time and avoid debugging.
- finish on paper then code it on pc.
- split your code🤦‍♂️.
- Debug.
- Debug.

## Submit 🚀
