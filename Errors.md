# Wrong Answer
- Overflow
- Negative case in MOD.
- IO format/input.
- No more test cases.
- fixed precisions.
- (l,r) , (i,j)
- +1 , -1
- Distinct or duplicates
- assumption
- take mod
- compiler
- dp-return
- map or array
- binary search fast break 
- data structure
- continue
- fast io
- pre calculation
- handling -1 case
- clean code(keep it simple stupid)

# RTE
- not handling base cases
- divide by zero
- out of bounds

# Debug
- i,j,k
- not taking whole input
- base zero vs base one 
- distinct or duplicate
- ++i,--i
- n-1,m
- template
- 1<< or 1ll<<
- segment Tree (one or pow)
- l,r,mid,ans
